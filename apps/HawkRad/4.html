            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                Hawking’s Theory of black hole decay, by applying knowledge of Virtual Particles 
                and the effects of an Event Horizon, show that black holes emit Hawking Radiation. 
                Although the concept itself is relatively simple compared to the mountain of knowledge 
                required to understand it, this theory’s importance is still seen today. In fact new 
                evidence may bring this theory into reality. Scientists have run experiments with 
                artificial even horizons, looking for hawking radiation emission, and they think they 
                saw some (ArXiv, 2012). Perhaps, his theory will be proven incorrect by another brilliant 
                scientist, as unafraid of progress as Hawking. Regardless, Stephen Hawking himself 
                never believed in one grand Theory of Everything, yet he would undoubtedly be pleased 
                that his theory enacted as a stepping stone for the future to unveil itself onto the world.

                I hope these simulations helped spread this knowledge to others in a someone function and approachable way.
