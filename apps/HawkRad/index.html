            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Thought researching this project, I found how quickly each topic branched off into several other, more complex topics. I often found myself lost down the rabbit hole, learning about things that had nothing to do with my original topic. I also discovered that while it is hard to gather the knowledge required to understand something yourself itâ€™s even harder to explain it in simple terms, without compromising accuracy. Overall, I really enjoyed researching this topic, and writing about it helped me hone in my teaching and explanatory skills.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>So what is Hawking Radiation, and how does it affect the scientific world?</h4>
            <p>
                Hawking Radiation is the result of interference between General Relativity and Quantum Theory. General Relativity outlines gravity as curves in space-time rather than a force, and Quantum Theory describes everything as being made of discrete and very small units called quanta. These two very important theories are not very compatible, interacting in very problematic ways.

            <p>
                Out of every conflict between the two models, black holes, in a literal sense, are the most massive. The very concept of an event horizon appears contradict the laws of Thermodynamics and Symmetry, yet these issues were nearly completely resolved by the late Stephen Hawking and his theory of black hole decay.
